If we think about our first sprint retrospective, we can divide it into categories
which are start, stop, continue, more of, less of. Our team has done since the beginning working together, which minimizes the possible errors or bugs that might occure.
But we could start to think more about the refactoring of the code since it is also really important.

We have to continue communicating regularly on what could be improved on the project and listen to others' opinion on different things. 
In case of "more of", we should keep up the pace which is currently great and has been working good since the beginning. 

If we think about "less of", it is great to practise more on how to solve different problems that we face in git, for instance solving merge conflicts and remembering to keep work done seperately on different branches.
